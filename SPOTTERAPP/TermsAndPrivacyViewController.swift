This document may be amended from time to time with the addition of new features and services, or the alteration of existing features and services, or otherwise by our discretion. These amendments will be made without notice to you and will be effective as soon as the changes are made to this document.\n \nIntellectual Property: You must not reproduce, modify or adapt anything on this app for use elsewhere, without our prior consent. Including but not limited to intellectual property rights and copyright which is owned or licensed by us, or used by permission from a third party.\n \nProper Use: The SPOTTER app and any of its contents must not be used: a. In breach of the law or any regulation. b. To infringe on the rights of a third party. c. In breach of any standards or requirements practiced and/or promoted by any relevant authority, or d. In association with any information that might be, or that might promote abusive, threatening, defamatory, unlawful, obscene, profane, pornographic or indecent conduct.\n \nExternal Data Suppliers: SPOTTER displays information produced by external API’s including the WillyWeather API and Google Maps API. SPOTTER is not affiliated with these organisations and is privately run.\n \nData Disclaimer and Liability Indemnity: a. General – the information provided by SPOTTER is distributed in hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. B. Emergency situations – Information provided by SPOTTER must not be used in emergency situations. In emergencies, please refer to ‘The Bureau of Meteorology warnings page’. C. The nature of weather – It is important to remember that weather is unpredictable. Weather forecasting is not an exact science, and weather observations can contain errors, omissions or loss of data. D. System failures and technical glitches – It is also important to remember that system failures and technical glitches can occur that may result in errors, omissions, loss of data or notifications failures. These include (but are not limited to) server failure, software logical errors, power outages, and anything else that results in SPOTTER systems failures.\n \nPrivacy Statement: a. General - There are a limited number of instances in which SPOTTER has access to user information of non-account holders that might be considered 'private'. To demonstrate our ongoing commitment to the privacy of any current or future user of SPOTTER this privacy statement has been created, and will be updated from time to time as the SPOTTER app adds functions and services that might require changes to this document. b. Location Services - If the 'location based services' option has been enabled then the SPOTTER app will use this information to provide weather information specific to the users location. Some location information as well as other system related information (such as app version and operating system version) may also be used through the feedback and support section of the app in order to help us troubleshoot issues relevant to the support of users to the SPOTTER service. c. SPOTTER Account Holders - SPOTTER respects the private and confidential Information given to it by account holders. This information is used to facilitate the features used in the account system with regards to the delivery of weather services, and will not be sold, loaned or rented to any third party, unless account holders have opted to receive relevant offers by our partners. d. Contact Information - SPOTTER will occasionally run online surveys and contests that may ask for the contact information of users (such as a name and email address). This contact information is used to contact users where necessary, and is only given to a third party if the third party is directly involved in the survey or contest. e. IP Address - The SPOTTER app captures the IP address of users that access the feedback and support section of the app, to help us diagnose any issues that may be outlined in correspondence between SPOTTER and its users. The SPOTTER app will also use IP addresses to view analytics data that help us to understand the demographic of SPOTTER app users as well as traffic numbers. This information helps us administer the app in many ways, including ensuring that our servers, software and data are performing correctly, and that any issues can be diagnosed."
